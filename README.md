Enhanced Security System in Cloud Using Lightweight Homomorphic Cryptographic  Algorithm.

A new cryptographic technique was proposed which has two encryption layers namely a Lightweight cryptographic algorithm (L1) and a Multiplicative homomorphic scheme(L2).L1 integrates Feistel structure, substitution-permutation, and Shannonâ€™s theory, employing logical operations like XOR, XNOR, shifting, and swapping. The second layer is based on asymmetric cryptography, which uses public and private keys for encryption. The approach modifies RSA through the implementation of a homomorphic encryption algorithm. By implementing this two-layer encryption methodology users can overcome the security issues in cloud computing.

In this repositary, we have included python code (python3) in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and in Python IDLE ( 3.10 - 64 bits and 3.11 - 64 bits ). 
Sample input text file is provided which contains 848 characters.
Key is of 128- bit length.

We have done implementation out of inspiration from the paper,
